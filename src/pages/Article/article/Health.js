    <div className='hhmain'><h2>The thawing of ancient permafrost due to climate change may pose a new threat to humans, according to researchers who revived nearly two dozen viruses – including one frozen under a lake more than 48,500 years ago. European researchers examined ancient samples collected from permafrost in the Siberia region of Russia. They revived and characterized 13 new pathogens, what they termed “zombie viruses,” and found that they remained infectious despite spending many millennia trapped in the frozen ground. Scientists have long warned that the thawing of permafrost due to atmospheric warming will worsen climate change by freeing previously trapped greenhouse gases like methane. But its effect on dormant pathogens is less well understood. The team of researchers from Russia, Germany and France said the biological risk of reanimating the viruses they studied was “totally negligible” due to the strains they targeted, mainly those capable of infecting amoeba microbes. The potential revival of a virus that could infect animals or humans is much more problematic, they said, warning that their work can be extrapolated to show the danger is real. “It is thus likely that ancient permafrost will release these unknown viruses upon thawing,” they wrote in an article posted to the preprint repository bioRxiv that hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed. “How long these viruses could remain infectious once exposed to outdoor conditions, and how likely they will be to encounter and infect a suitable host in the interval, is yet impossible to estimate.” “But the risk is bound to increase in the context of global warming when permafrost thawing will keep accelerating, and more people will be populating the Arctic in the wake of industrial ventures,” they said. Our new weekly Impact Report newsletter will examine how ESG news and trends are shaping the roles and responsibilities of today’s executives—and how they can best navigate those challenges.</h2></div>
    <div className='hhnext'><h2>There currently is not enough clarity on whether these particular zombie viruses will infect a host if thawed under outdoor conditions such as heat, oxygen and UV rays. However, the researchers argue that the risks remain, especially as more and more people begin to occupy the melting Arctic for commercial and industrial ventures.
"It is therefore legitimate to ponder the risk of ancient viral particles remaining infectious and getting back into circulation by the thawing of ancient permafrost layers," said the study.The authors warn that some of these “zombie viruses” could potentially be dangerous to humans. As seen previously, thawing permafrost can claim human lives. In 2016, an anthrax outbreak in Siberia led to the death of a child and dozens of people were also hospitalized. As per the officials, the outbreak possibly started after a heat wave thawed the permafrost and unearthed a reindeer carcass that was infected with anthrax decades ago.Despite the potential risk factor, there is no need to panic, especially if you think the researchers would expose these viruses into the atmosphere.
As per researchers, there is no harm done by reviving the viruses for this research. More importantly, the strains that were studied mainly infect only amoeba microbes.</h2></div>
